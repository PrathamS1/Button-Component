Here's a quick review...
This is the solution to the challenge Button Component from devchallenges.io. The challenge was to create different buttons as per the user need.
The solution is live and you can visit the page by clicking on the Demo above.
It was worth accepting the challenge as I got to know various styles and functions that can be applied to buttons. While making the solution I learned more about javascript functions and css styles.
It is always best to start from simple challenges and move your way to the top gradually.
